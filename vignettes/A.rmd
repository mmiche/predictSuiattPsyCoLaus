## predictSuiattPsyCoLaus - Supplementary R package

suiatt = suicide attempt.

PsyCoLaus is the name of the study whose data has been used.

This supplementary R package is part of the publication 'Evaluating the clinical utility of a newly developed and validated prediction model of suicide attempts on the basis of a general community sample of adults'

### predictSuiattPsyCoLaus vignettes - Structure

This vignette provides a short explanation of how this predictSuiattPsyCoLaus package is structured.

Our predictSuiattPsyCoLaus package is structured in alphabetical order. Each vignette's name consists of an upper case letter, following the alphabetical order.

### Detailed code inspection

Best research practice guidelines recommend *to publish all code and data*, along with the main research article. Data protection laws prohibit the publication of the original data of the PsyCoLaus study. Therefore, we use the published results (see Table 1 in the research article) as the basis to simulate data, which is superficially similar to the original data. Importantly, we provide all code, starting with the simulation code (see vignette B).

## Vignettes A-E in this predictSuiattPsyCoLaus package
