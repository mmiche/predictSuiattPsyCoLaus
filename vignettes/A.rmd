## predictSuiattPsyCoLaus - Supplementary R package

suiatt = suicide attempt.

PsyCoLaus is the name of the study whose data has been used.

This supplementary R package is part of the publication 'Evaluating the clinical utility of an easily applicable prediction model of suicide attempts, newly developed and validated with a general community sample of adults'

### predictSuiattPsyCoLaus vignettes - Structure

This vignette (A) provides a short explanation of how this predictSuiattPsyCoLaus package is structured: It is structured in alphabetical order. Each vignette's name consists of an upper case letter, following the alphabetical order.

### Detailed code inspection

Best research practice guidelines (e.g., Boulesteix, 2015) recommend *to publish all code and data*, along with the main article. Local data protection laws prohibit the publication of the original data of the PsyCoLaus study. Therefore, we use the published results (see Table 1 in the main article) as the basis to simulate data, which is superficially similar to the original data. Importantly, we provide all code, starting with the simulation code (see vignette B: Simulation code).

## All vignettes A-G in this predictSuiattPsyCoLaus package

1. A: predictSuiattPsyCoLaus Read me first: predictSuiattPsyCoLaus introduction and overview of the other vignettes.

2. B: Simulation code.

3. C: Predict suicide attempt, using logistic regression.

4. D: Predict suicide attempt, using classification and regression trees (CART).

5. E: Extract and display clinical utility results (from logistic regression and from CART).

6. F: Display discrimination and calibration from logistic regression.

7. G: Conduct and display result of CART sensitivity analysis.
